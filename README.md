# Introduction to Apache Openwhisk Serverless Platform (Colo Spgs Open Source)

## Presentation at Colo Spgs Open Source Meetup
Join us for an introduction to Serverless concepts including Actions and Triggers on the OpenWhisk Serverless open source platform. Apache OpenWhisk (Incubating) is an open source, distributed Serverless platform that executes functions (fx) in response to events at any scale. The idea is for developers to stop worrying about server management and focus on code. OpenWhisk manages the infrastructure, servers and scaling using Docker containers so you can focus on building amazing and efficient applications. We will look at the serverless landscape, current shortcomings and some workarounds. The lecture will be followed by a demo.

Why Openwhisk?

FaaS or Function as a Service is the trending topic of interest these days. This deep dive will introduce the members to the concepts and the general landscape in this field. We will use OpenWhisk for a demonstration with Java. Openwhisk currently supports Java, JavaScript, Go, PHP, Python, Swift, Ruby and any other language with Docker.
